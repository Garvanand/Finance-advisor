# Financial Data Fetcher

This Python script demonstrates a simple system for fetching financial articles based on user queries and generating keywords related to personal finance using language models. It also showcases an access control system using Opal for enforcing permissions based on user roles.


## Usage

1. Run the script using `python app.py`.
2. Access the application through a Gradio interface to check access control permissions based on user role and action.
3. Enter the user role and action you want to check permissions for.
4. Review the output to see if permission is granted or denied for the specified action.
